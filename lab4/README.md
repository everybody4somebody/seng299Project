# Lab 4

This is code template for SENG 299 Summer 2016 Lab 4. 

## Purpose

The purpose of lab 4 is to familiarize students with drawing SVG shapes in a web browser and using jQuery to manipulate the DOM tree. Students are asked to finish the web application by having the client side JavaScript programmatically generate a Go board based on data returned from the server. 

## Usage

To run the server: 

1. Checkout/download the code: `git clone https://github.com/sdiemert/seng299lab.git`
2. Move to lab 4 directory: `cd seng299lab/lab4`
3. Start the server: `node server.js`

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the web appliation.

## Student Task

Students are required to implement functionality in: 

* `lab4/public/svgFactory.js`
* `lab4/public/script.js`

This includes methods for creating SVG shapes and then using those methods to programmatically draw a Go board to the web page. 

Creative board designs are encouraged!
